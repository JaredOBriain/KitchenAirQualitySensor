📡 RRH62000 Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System
Overview

This project is a real-time indoor air quality monitoring system built around the RRH62000 sensor.

It consists of three coordinated Python services:

Sensor Logger – Collects and logs raw sensor data

Watchdog – Monitors values and generates alerts

Dashboard – Displays live graphs and alerts

All services operate together to provide continuous environmental monitoring.

1️⃣ Sensor Logger
Purpose

Reads data from the RRH62000 sensor over I²C and logs it to rotating hourly CSV files.

Key Features

1 Hz data acquisition

Automatic hourly file rotation

Header auto-creation

Maintains latest.csv symlink

Calculates custom EU-weighted IAQ index (IAQ_CUSTOM)

Output Files
Hourly Data Log
rrh62000_2026-03-02_14.csv

Live Pointer
latest.csv → rrh62000_2026-03-02_14.csv


All other services read latest.csv for consistency.

IAQ_CUSTOM Calculation

The custom IAQ index is based on EU / WHO reference limits:

Parameter	Reference	Weight
PM2.5	25 µg/m³	40%
PM10	50 µg/m³	20%
TVOC	300 µg/m³	20%
CO₂	1000 ppm	20%

The index is scaled to:

0–40 → Excellent

40–70 → Good

70–100 → Moderate

100–150 → Poor

150 → Very Poor

2️⃣ Watchdog
Purpose

Continuously monitors live data and detects threshold violations.

How It Works

Reads latest.csv

Computes rolling average (last N samples)

Compares against predefined limits

Tracks exposure duration

Logs alerts if limits exceeded

Alert Logging

Alerts are stored hourly in:

alerts/alerts_YYYYMMDD_HH.csv


Each alert entry includes:

Timestamp

Parameter name

Rolling average

Limit value

Exposure duration

Sample window size

GPIO Alert

If any parameter exceeds limits:

LED flashes on configured GPIO pin

Alert entry is written to CSV

3️⃣ Dashboard
Purpose

Provides a live graphical display of:

Particulate levels

Gas concentrations

Temperature & humidity

IAQ_CUSTOM

Active alerts

Features

Dark theme

Live updating (every ~1 second)

Only reads last N rows (performance optimized)

Bottom-corner alert panel

Automatically follows hourly file via latest.csv

Alert Display

If alerts are active:

ALERTS:
PM2.5_KCl = 45.3 (limit 20) [120s]
eCO2_ppm = 1300 (limit 1000) [60s]


Alerts automatically clear when conditions return to normal.

🔄 Hourly Rotation Mechanism

Every hour:

Sensor Logger creates new hourly file

Header is written

latest.csv is updated to point to new file

Watchdog and Dashboard automatically follow the new file

No restart required.

⚙ Configuration Points

Each script contains configurable parameters:

Logger

LOG_INTERVAL

IAQ weighting

I2C bus & address

Watchdog

SAMPLE_WINDOW

CHECK_INTERVAL

Limit thresholds

GPIO pin

Dashboard

MAX_POINTS

Update interval

Grid layout

Colour map

Alert position


🛠 Recommended Deployment

Run all three via systemd:

rrh62000-stack.service

rrh62000-dashboard.service

Start order:

Logger

Watchdog

Dashboard



🧠 Summary

This system provides:

Continuous environmental monitoring

Health-weighted air quality modelling

Live visualisation

Exposure-aware alerting

Robust file rotation

Efficient runtime behaviour

It is structured for long-term unattended operation on embedded hardware.
